## Overview

[HubSpot](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/reference/api) is an AI-powered customer platform with all the software, integrations, and resources you need to connect your marketing, sales, and customer service

The `ballerinax/hubspot.crm.object.feedback` package offers APIs to connect and interact with [HubSpot API](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/reference/api) endpoints, specifically based on [HubSpot API v3](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/reference/api).

>**_NOTE:_**             
This package may be changed in the future based on the HubSpot API changes, since it is currently under development and is subject to change based on testing and feedback. By using this package, you are agreeing to accept any future changes that might occur and understand the risk associated with testing an unstable API.

## Setup guide

To use the HubSpot Feedback connector, you must have access to the HubSpot API through a HubSpot developer account and a HubSpot App under it. Therefore you need to register for a developer account at HubSpot if you don't have one already.

### Step 1: Create/Login to a HubSpot Developer Account

If you have an account already, go to the [HubSpot developer portal](https://app.hubspot.com/)

If you don't have a HubSpot Developer Account you can sign up to a free account [here](https://developers.hubspot.com/get-started)

### Step 2 (Optional): Create a [Developer Test Account](https://developers.hubspot.com/beta-docs/getting-started/account-types#developer-test-accounts) under your account

Within app developer accounts, you can create developer test accounts to test apps and integrations without affecting any real HubSpot data.

**_These accounts are only for development and testing purposes. In production you should not use Developer Test Accounts._**
